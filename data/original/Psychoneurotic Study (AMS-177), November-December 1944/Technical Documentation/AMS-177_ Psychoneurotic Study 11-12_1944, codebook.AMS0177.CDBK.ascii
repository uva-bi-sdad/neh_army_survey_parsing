0                1. THE USUAL LINE OF EVACUATION FOR A COMBAT NP IS AS FOLLOWS:  
                    HE GOES, OR IS SENT, TO THE BATTALION AID STATION.  IF       
                    JUDGED TO BE AN NP, HE IS SENT TO THE DIVISION,S TRAINING AND
                    REHABILITATION CENTER, WHICH IS THE PART OF ITS CLEARING     
                    STATION RESERVED FOR NP,S.  AT THE T & R CENTER ARE A        
                    PSYCHIATRIST, A REGULAR DOCTOR, AND AN INFANTRY OFFICER TO   
                    GIVE LIGHT DRILL AND EXERCISE.  USUALLY THE NP IS ALLOWED    
                    TO SLEEP WHEN HE ARRIVES AT THE T & R CENTER.  IT IS AFTER   
                    THIS SLEEP THAT HE TAKES OUR QUESTIONNAIRE, USUALLY IN       
                    COMPANY WITH 3-4 OR SO OTHERS, AND IT IS ADMINISTERED BY     
                    THE EM PSYCHOLOGIST.  THUS, USUALLY THE QUESTIONNAIRE IS     
                    TAKEN BEFORE THE NP KNOWS, OR CAN GUESS, HIS DISPOSITION.    
                    DISPOSITION IS EITHER BACK TO HIS OUTFIT, AFTER 4-5 DAYS     
                    REST AND MILD EXERCISE, OR TO 5TH ARMY,S 601ST CLEARING      
                    COMPANY.  THE PSYCHIATRISTS AT THE 601ST MAY EITHER RETURN   
                    A MAN TO HIS OUTFIT AFTER FURTHER REST AND MILD EXERCISE, OR 
                    SEND HIM TO THE 63RD CONVALESCENT HOSPITAL OR THE 114TH      
                    STATION HOSPITAL FOR RECLASSIFICATION TO LIMITED ASSIGNMENT. 
                    (THE 114TH ALSO HAS SOME CASES DIRECTLY FROM THE 92ND        
                    DIVISION,S T & R CENTER BECAUSE THE 601ST IS TOO FAR AWAY    
                    FROM THE 92ND).  THESE 2 HOSPITALS KEEP THE NP,S FOR ONLY    
                    2-3 DAYS WHILE RECLASSIFYING THEM AND SHIPPING THEM TO THE   
                    27TH (FORMERLY THE 7TH) REPLACEMENT DEPOT.  HERE THEY AWAIT  
                    REASSIGNMENT TO REAR-ECHELON JOBS.  THERE ARE MINOR          
                    VARIATIONS AT ALL STAGES FROM THIS STANDARD LINE OF          
                    EVACUATION.                                                  
0                2. THE AWOLS ARE ALL THOSE IN WHITE INFANTRY DIVISION STOCKADES 
                    DURING THE TIME OF THE SURVEY.  ALL BUT ABOUT A HALF DOZEN   
                    WERE CHARGED WITH VIOLATING THE 58TH (DESERTION), 61ST       
                    (ABSENCE WITHOUT LEAVE) OR 75TH (MISBEHAVIOR BEFORE THE      
                    ENEMY) ARTICLES OF WAR, AND WERE SENTENCED FOR 6 MONTHS OR   
                    LESS.  FROM TALKING THE MATTER OVER WITH THE PRISONERS,      
                    GUARDS, AND OFFICERS-IN-CHARGE, IT WOULD SEEM THAT THERE     
                    WAS LITTLE OR NO REAL DIFFERENCE AS TO WHICH OF THESE 3 AW   
                    THE MEN WERE CHARGED WITH, AND THEREFORE THEY MAY ALL BE     
                    CALLED AWOL.  WHO GETS SENT TO THE DIVISION STOCKADE IS      
                    PARTLY A MATTER OF DIVISION PRACTICE, BUT IT IS SUPPOSED TO  
                    BE THAT THE MORE SERIOUS CASES TRIED BY GENERAL COURTS-      
                    MARTIAL ARE SENT TO THE THEATER DISCIPLINARY TRAINING        
                    CENTERS RATHER THAN TO DIVISION STOCKADES.  THE 34TH

0                   DIVISION SENDS ALL ITS AWOLS BACK TO THEIR UNIT OR TO THE    
                    DTC, AND THEREFORE COULD NOT BE REPRESENTED IN THIS SURVEY.  
0                3. THE "NORMAL" WHITE INFANTRYMEN ARE FROM RIFLE COMPANIES AND  
                    HEAVY WEAPONS COMPANIES IN THE 4 WHITE INFANTRY DIVISIONS    
                    IN THE THEATER (34TH, 85TH, 88TH, 91ST).  THERE IS A SLIGHTLY
                    HIGHER PROPORTION OF HEAVY WEAPONS MEN IN THE SAMPLE THAN IN 
                    THE UNIVERSE; THIS WAS DONE TO GET ENOUGH MEN WITH A LONG    
                    TIME IN COMBAT.  MANY OF THE HEAVY WEAPONS MEN WERE FORMERLY 
                    RIFLEMEN.  IN EVERY DIVISION, MORE THAN ONE BATTALION WAS    
                    REPRESENTED, BUT ONLY IN THE 85TH WAS THERE OPPORTUNITY TO   
                    GET MORE THAN ONE REGIMENT REPRESENTED.                      
0                4. THE NORMALS WERE GIVEN THE QUESTIONNAIRES DURING THE FIRST   
                    2 WEEKS OF APRIL, JUST AS THE MAJOR OFFENSIVE WAS BEGINNING  
                    WHICH WAS TO KNOCK THE GERMANS OUT OF THE WAR IN ITALY.      
                    ALL THE MEN KNEW ABOUT THE APPROACHING OFFENSIVE, AND IT     
                    IS BELIEVED THAT THE GENERAL EXPECTATION WAS THAT A TOUGH    
                    FIGHT WAS AHEAD.  THE AWOLS WERE GIVEN THE QUESTIONNAIRE     
                    DURING THE LAST WEEK IN MARCH, 1945.  THE NP,S, BOTH IN THE  
                    T & R CENTERS AND IN THE REPLACEMENT DEPOTS, FILLED OUT      
                    QUESTIONNAIRES BETWEEN THE LAST WEEK IN DECEMBER 1944 AND THE
                    LAST WEEK IN APRIL 1945.  IT IS POSSIBLE THAT IN A SMALL     
                    PROPORTION OF CASES, THE SAME NP,S FILLED OUT THE QUESTION-  
                    NAIRES IN BOTH T & R CENTER AND REPLACEMENT DEPOTS.          
0                5. THE "NORMALS" ARE A PRETTY GOOD CROSS-SECTION OF WHITE       
                    COMBAT INFANTRYMEN IN THE THEATER.  THE AWOLS ARE PRACTICALLY
                    A 100 PERCENT SAMPLE OF PRISONERS IN WHITE INFANTRY DIVISION 
                    STOCKADES AT THE TIME.  THE NPS AT THE REPLACEMENT DEPOTS    
                    ARE PRACTICALLY A 100 PERCENT SAMPLE OF MEN RECLASSIFIED FOR 
                    NP REASONS AT THE 4 DATES THE REPLACEMENT DEPOTS WERE        
                    VISITED.  THERE IS A BIAS, HOWEVER, IN THE NPS AT THE        
                    DIVISION T & R CENTERS:  A.) THE MOST SEVERE CASES AND THE   
                    ILLITERATES WERE USUALLY NOT GIVEN A QUESTIONNAIRE TO FILL   
                    OUT.  B.) MOST OF THE PERIOD DURING WHICH THE QUESTIONNAIRE  
                    WAS ADMINISTERED WAS ONE OF HOLDING ACTION, EXCEPT FOR THE   
                    OFFENSIVE AT THE END.                                        
0                6. FOR NP,S FROM THE T & R CENTERS ONLY, WE MADE UP A           
                    "DIVISIONAL DATA SHEET", TO BE FILLED OUT BY THE PSYCHIATRIST
                    OR THE EM PSYCHOLOGIST AS PART OF THE REGULAR ROUTINE OF     
                    PROCESSING.  ON THIS SHEET WERE PUT THE MAN,S DISPOSITION    
                    AND ENOUGH PERSONAL BACKGROUND QUESTIONS TO IDENTIFY THE     
                    MAN,S QUESTIONNAIRE.  THE PURPOSE OF THIS WAS TO DETERMINE   
                    WHETHER THE NP WAS RETURNED TO DUTY OR SENT TO THE 601ST.    
                    AT THE 601ST, A COPY OF THE REGULAR "DISPOSITION" SHEET USED 
                    BY THE PSYCHIATRIST WAS SENT TO US SO WE COULD DETERMINE     
                    WHICH MEN WERE RETURNED TO DUTY AND WHICH WERE TO BE         
                    RECLASSIFIED (OR ZI,ED).                                     
0                METHOD OF SAMPLING AND DATA COLLECTION                          
                    FOR THE GENERAL CASE, SAMPLING WAS A TWO-STEP PROCESS.       
                    FIRST, THERE WAS SAMPLING OF ORGANIZATIONS WHICH CAN BE      
                    DESCRIBED AS PURPOSIVE OR QUOTA SAMPLING.  SECOND,           
                    WITHIN AN ORGANIZATION THERE WAS SAMPLING OF INDIVIDUALS

                    SELECTION OF UNITS INVOLVED PURPOSIVE RATHER THAN STRICTLY   
                    RANDOM SAMPLING.  IF A CROSS-SECTION OF ENLISTED MEN IN      
                    THE UNITED STATES OR A THEATER WAS REQUIRED, THE STANDARD    
                    PROCEDURE WAS TO SELECT THE UNITS SUCH THAT EACH BRANCH OF   
                    SERVICE WAS REPRESENTED IN AS NEARLY AS POSSIBLE THE CORRECT 
                    PROPORTIONS.  THE RESEARCH BRANCH HAD ACCESS TO THE LATEST   
                    SECRET DATA ON TROOP STRENGTH AND LOCATION OF UNITS.         
                    WITHIN A GIVEN BRANCH OF SERVICE, EFFORT WAS MADE TO GET     
                    UNITS IN VARIOUS STAGES OF TRAINING OR WITH VARIOUS TYPES    
                    OF ARMY EXPERIENCE IN CORRECT PROPORTIONS, IN SO FAR AS THIS 
                    COULD BE INFERRED FROM AVAILABLE DATA.  HAVING STRATIFIED    
                    THE UNIVERSE BY BRANCH AND TYPE OF UNIT, ONE OR MORE UNITS   
                    FROM EACH SUBCELL OF THIS STRATIFIED UNIVERSE WERE DRAWN.    
                    PRACTICAL CONSIDERATIONS OF TIME AND PERSONNEL USUALLY       
                    PREVENTED A STRICTLY RANDOM SELECTION OF UNITS WITHIN THE    
                    SUBCELL; IT WAS MUCH FASTER TO GET A VARIETY OF UNITS AT A   
                    FEW POSTS THAN ONE UNIT AT MANY POSTS.  PRESELECTION OF UNITS
                    WAS DONE IN WASHINGTON FOR TROOPS IN THE UNITED STATES OR AT 
                    THEATER HEADQUARTERS FOR TROOPS OVERSEAS.                    
0                2. SAMPLING OF INDIVIDUALS WITHIN A UNIT: THE STANDARD PROCEDURE
                    WAS TO DRAW THE NAMES OF EVERY NTH MAN FROM A DUTY ROSTER.   
                    OR, IF THE STUDY DESIGN CALLED FOR CERTAIN NUMBERS AT A      
                    GIVEN RANK OR A GIVEN AGE, THE RESEARCH TEAM HAD ACCESS TO   
                    THE SOLDIER,S FORM 20 CARDS CONTAINING ALL SUCH INFORMATION. 
                    FOR ANY DESIRED CATEGORY OF MEN THESE CARDS COULD BE SAMPLED 
                    AT RANDOM AND THE MEN WHOSE NAMES WERE DRAWN COULD BE        
                    ORDERED TO APPEAR AT A DESIGNATED TIME AND PLACE.            
0                3. QUESTIONNAIRE ADMINISTRATION: NORMALLY A SAMPLE OF ABOUT     
                    FIFTY ENLISTED MEN WERE ASSEMBLED BY ORDER OF THEIR UNIT

                    LEADER WAS ALMOST ALWAYS AN ENLISTED MAN TRAINED FOR THE     
                    PURPOSE.  THE QUESTIONNAIRES WERE FILLED OUT ANONYMOUSLY BY  
                    THE MEN, IT HAVING BEEN ESTABLISHED THAT NO SIGNIFICANT      
                    DIFFERENCES OCCURRED IN RESPONSES WITH PERSONAL INTERVIEWS.  
                    MEN WITH LITTLE EDUCATION OR WHO WERE HAVING DIFFICULTY      
                    READING THE QUESTIONNAIRE WERE INTERVIEWED INDIVIDUALLY      
                    (PERSONALLY INTERVIEWED NEGRO TROOPS HAD NEGRO               
                    INTERVIEWERS).

                    AFTER EACH SURVEY THE SAMPLING EXPERTS CHECKED THE RETURNS   
                    TO SEE WHETHER LARGE BIASES HAD OCCURRED ON VARIABLES FOR    
                    WHICH DATA WERE AVAILABLE FOR THE UNIVERSE - SUCH AS RANK,   
                    LENGTH OF TIME IN THE ARMY, AGE, ETC.  IN A FEW INSTANCES,   
                    THE SAMPLE REVEALED A BIAS; WHEN FEASIBLE A CORRECTIVE SAMPLE
                    WAS DRAWN IMMEDIATELY.  IT WAS FELT THAT BIASES INTRODUCED   
                    BY SAMPLING DESIGNS AND THEIR FIELD EXECUTION WERE VERY      
                    SMALL AS COMPARED WITH THOSE ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE WORDING OF  
                    QUESTIONS.  MUCH EFFORT WAS PUT INTO IMPROVING METHODS OF
