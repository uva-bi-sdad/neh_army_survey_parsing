11704,S76.Qi1A,S76, THE BEST WAY TO GET MOST MEN TO BEHAVE IS TO PUNISH THEM EVERYTIME THEY DON'T BEHAVE.
11705,S76.Qi1B,S76," A NONCOM SHOULD ALWAYS KEEP HIS MEN BUSY DURING DUTY HOURS, EVEN IF HE HAS TO MAKE THEM DO UNNECESSARY WORK."
11706,S76.Qi1C,S76, A NONCOM HAS TO BE VERY STRICT WITH HIS MEN OR ELSE THEY WILL TAKE ADVANTAGE OF HIM.
11707,S76.Qi1D,S76, IT IS JUST AS IMPORTANT FOR A NONCOM TO BE LIKED BY HIS MEN AS IT IS FOR HIM TO KNOW HIS STUFF.
11708,S76.Qi1E,S76, MEN LEARN BETTER WHEN THEY KNOW WHY A SUBJECT IS BEING TAUGHT.
11709,S76.Qi1F,S76, A NONCOM WHO IS FRIENDLY IN THE BARRACKS LOSES SOME OF HIS AUTHORITY ON THE DRILL FIELD.
11710,S76.Qi1G,S76, A NONCOM CAN DO A BETTER JOB IF THE MEN IN HIS SQUAD ARE AFRAID OF HIM.

11716,S76.Qi1M,S76, A SUBJECT SHOULD NEVER BE TAUGHT WITHOUT THE MEN BEING TOLD WHY THEY HAVE TO LEARN IT.
11717,S76.Qi1N,S76, THE MEN SHOULD NOT EXPECT THEIR NONCOM TO GO OUT OF HIS WAY TO HELP THEM SINCE HE HAS HIS OWN TROUBLES.
11718,S76.Qi1O,S76, A NONCOM SHOULD ALWAYS INSIST THAT HIS MEN DO EVERYTHING EXACTLY AS STATED IN REGULATIONS.
11719,S76.Qi2A,S76," A NONCOM WHO REALLY DOES HIS JOB, CANNOT EXPECT TO BE POPULAR WITH THE MEN."

11722,S76.Qi2D,S76," ON A FATIGUE DETAIL, A NONCOM SHOULD SEE THAT THE MEN UNDER HIM GET THE WORK DONE, BUT SHOULD NOT HELP THEM DO IT."

11725,S76.Qi2G,S76," NO MATTER HOW STUPID THE MEN IN A SQUAD ARE, A GOOD NONCOM CAN MAKE GOOD SOLDIERS OUT OF THEM."
11726,S76.Qi2H,S76, GIVING FATIGUE DETAIL TO A MAN WHO FALLS ASLEEP IN CLASS IS A GOOD WAY TO MAKE HIM PAY ATTENTION NEXT TIME.
11727,S76.Qi2I,S76, A NONCOM SHOULD DISCOURAGE HIS MEN FROM BOTHERING HIM WITH THEIR PERSONAL PROBLEMS.
11728,S76.Qi2J,S76, A NONCOM WILL LOSE SOME OF THE RESPECT OF HIS MEN IF HE PALS AROUND WITH THEM OFF-DUTY.
11729,S76.Qi2K,S76, A NONCOM IN CHARGE OF A DETAIL SHOULD USUALLY KEEP THE MEN WORKING AT A FAST PACE.
11730,S76.Qi2L,S76, A NONCOM SHOULD BE AS STRICT IN THE CLASSROOM AS HE IS ON THE DRILL-FIELD.
11731,S76.Qi2M,S76," WHENEVER HE CAN, THE NONCOM SHOULD LET THE MEN DECIDE AMONG THEMSELVES AS TO THE BEST WAY TO DO A JOB."
