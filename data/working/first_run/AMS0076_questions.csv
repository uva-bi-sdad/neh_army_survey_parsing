THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPH HAS BEEN EXTRACTED FROM THE ORIGINAL DOCUMENTATION, AND IS INCLUDED HERE TO INDICATE THAT AT THE TIME OF THE STUDY THERE WAS A PROBLEM IDENTIFYING NON- COMMISSIONED OFFICERS. E. THE QUESTION ""WHAT IS YOUR RANK OR GRADE"" (PART V, Q.5) FELL DOWN SERIOUSLY ON THIS STUDY - NOT AS A USABLE QUESTION GENERALLY, BUT IN VIEW OF THE INFORMATION DESIRED HERE. WHERE IT IS IMPORTANT TO IDENTIFY THE SQUAD SERGEANT AND CORPORAL THIS QUESTION IS NOT ADEQUATE INASMUCH AS SO OFTEN THE SERGEANT AND CORPORAL ARE REALLY PRIVATES ONLY ACTING IN A NONCOM CAPACITY. THEY HAVE THE AUTHORITY AND POSITION OF THE NONCOM AS LONG AS THEY ARE ACTING IN THIS CAPACITY, BUT NOT GENERALLY. A NUMBER OF CASES OCCURRED IN WHICH BOTH WERE CORPORALS AND IT IS NOW IMPOSSIBLE TO FIND WHICH OF THE TWO WAS ACTING AS SERGEANT IN THE SQUAD. THESE MEN SHOULD GET NONCOM QUESTIONNAIRES AND SOME PROVISION SHOULD BE MADE FOR THEM TO ANSWER THE QUESTIONS AS NONCOMS IN THEIR ACTING CAPACITY. TO ELIMINATE THE DIFFICULTY OF IDENTIFI- CATION, IT WOULD BE ADVISABLE TO INCLUDE THE QUESTION ON MAIN ARMY JOB CITING AS EXAMPLES: RIFLEMAN, SQUAD LEADER, ACTING SQUAD LEADER, ETC. THIS WOULD ENABLE US TO GET THE MAN'S ACTUAL GRADE AND AT THE SAME TIME KNOW WHICH WAS THE SQUAD LEADER AND WHICH NOT. AS FAR AS GETTING NONCOM SCHEDULES TO THESE MEN IN THE ADMINISTRATIVE SITUATION IS CONCERNED, THAT CAN BE EASILY ENOUGH ASCERTAINED BY THE CLASS LEADER, AS WAS ACTUALLY DONE SUCCESSFULLY AT CLAIBORNE WHERE MANY SUCH INSTANCES AROSE. WE FAILED HOWEVER TO MAKE A PROPER NOTE OF THIS ON THE QUESTIONNAIRE ITSELF, SO BACK HERE IN WASHINGTON ARE FINDING IT NECESSARY TO TOSS THE NONCOM SCHEDULES WITH GRADE OF PRIVATE CHECKED BACK INTO THE GENERAL SQUAD PILE. MAYBE SOME PRIVATES GOT NONCOM SCHEDULES BY MISTAKE; WE KNOW A FEW DID. WITH AN ACTING SERGEANT ANSWERING SUCH QUESTIONS AS ""HOW LONG HAS HE BEEN A NONCOM"" PROVISION MUST BE MADE FOR HIS ANSWERING THESE WITH RESPECT TO HIS ACTING CAPACITY. *****************************PART I***************************** P.
