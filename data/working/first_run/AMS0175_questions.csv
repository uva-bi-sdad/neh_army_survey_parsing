S0175.DECK.  175. SURVEY NUMBER 
"S0175.BALLOT.  X. BALLOT NUMBER GENERATED BY ROPER CENTER. E. CHEMICAL WARFARE TRAINING - TO DISCOVER SOLDIER PREFERENCES BETWEEN TWO FORMS OF CHEMICAL WARFARE TRAINING: WEARING GAS MASKS IN NORMAL DUTIES FOR ONE-HALF HOUR EACH WEEK, OR GOING THROUGH THE GAS CHAMBER ONCE PER MONTH PLUS CERTAIN INSTRUCTION IN CHEMICAL WARFARE SUBJECTS. THE SAMPLE WAS SO DRAWN THAT APPROXIMATELY HALF OF THE MEN AT THE TIME OF THE SURVEY WERE IN ORGANIZATIONS PARTICIPATING IN ONE OF THE CHEMICAL WARFARE TRAINING SCHEDULES AND HALF WERE PARTIC- IPATING IN THE OTHER. THE SAMPLE WAS DRAWN FOR THE CHEMICAL WARFARE PORTION OF THE STUDY AND WAS SET UP TO FORM FOUR CLASSES OF MEN WHO WERE SUPPOSEDLY HAVING THE ""SPECIAL TRAINING PROGRAM"" (CONSISTING OF GAS CHAMBER AND INSTRUCTION) AND FOUR CLASSES WHO WERE SUPPOSEDLY WEARING MASKS FOR THE ROUTINE HALF-HOUR EACH WEEK. THESE GROUPINGS INTO CLASSES WERE FAR FROM PURE, HOWEVER, PROBABLY BECAUSE THE TRAINING PROGRAM HAD NOT ACTUALLY BEEN CARRIED ON AS IT WAS ASSUMED TO HAVE BEEN. FOR EXAMPLE, MANY MEN WHO WERE SUPPOSEDLY ON THE ROUTINE TRAINING PROGRAM HAD ACTUALLY BEEN THROUGH THE GAS CHAMBER BECAUSE THE OFFICER IN CHARGE OF TRAINING IN THEIR UNITS HAD HAD ENOUGH INITIATIVE TO ARRANGE THIS AS A RELIEF FROM THE ROUTINE OF THE OTHER PROGRAM.
