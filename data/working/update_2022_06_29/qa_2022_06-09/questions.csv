9660,S218C.Q29,S218C,How do you feel about what you've done in this war?
9661,S218C.Q30,S218C,"Under the Army Score Card Plan, some men will be returned to the states because they have the highest point scores and therefore will be first in turn to get out of the Army.

9662,S218C.Q31,S218C,"In general, what do you think of the Army Score Card Plan (the point system)?"

9665,S218C.Q34,S218C,"If the Army Score Card Plan (the point system) is carried out in the way it is supposed to be, do you think it will give the men a square deal?"
9666,S218C.Q35,S218C,"Suppose the Army had decided not to use a point system for the release of enlisted men, but just to use a ""first in - first out"" plan - that is, to let men out of the Army in the same order as they came in and not to count time overseas, combat and number of children. how would you have felt about this?"

9672,S218C.Q39B,S218C,Was it easy or hard for you to figure out how many points you'd have?
9673,S218C.Q40,S218C,"When your official point score was figured out, did you get a chance to see it?"
9674,S218C.Q41,S218C,"Does your official point score show the right number of points for you? If my official point score does not show the right number of points, what is wrong?"
9675,S218C.Q42,S218C,"If your official point score does not show the right number of points for you, what is being done about it?"
9676,S218C.Q43,S218C,"As far as you can tell, how is the Army Score Card Plan (the point system) working out up to now?"
9677,S218C.Q44A,S218C,"Here are six general types of soldiers. if you think the point system gives any of them a better break than they should have, check the one you think gets the best break."
9678,S218C.Q44B,S218C,"Now we want to know if you think the point system gives any of these men a worse break than they should have. If any of them gets a worse break than they should have, check the one that you think gets the worst break."

9683,S218C.Q49,S218C,"When the points were figured, about how many enlisted men in your company (or battery, or squadron) had 85 points or more?"
9684,S218C.Q50,S218C,About how many 85 point men from your company (or battery or squadron) have already started home or been released under the point system?
9685,S218C.Q51,S218C,"If any 85 point men from your company have started home, how were they picked? What one thing do you think was most important in deciding who got to go and who did not?"
9686,S218C.Q53,S218C,How long have you been doing this?
9687,S218C.Q54,S218C,"As far as you know, are you now in an ""essential"" job? That is, are you now in a job from which high point men are not to be released?"
