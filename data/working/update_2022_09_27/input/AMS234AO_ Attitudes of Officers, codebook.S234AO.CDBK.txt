                                         TWO ARMY AIR FIELDS AND THREE ARMY

                                         PERSONNEL AND HOUSEKEEPING UNITS WERE   
                                         REPRESENTED.  IN THE AGF AND ASF SAMPLES
                                         NO BASIC TRAINEES OR MEN WHO HAD BEEN   
                                         IN THE ARMY LESS THAN SIX MONTHS WERE   
                                         DRAWN FOR THE SAMPLE.  ONLY OFFICERS    
                                         OF COMPANY GRADE WERE INCLUDED IN THE   
                                         OFFICER SAMPLE.  THE RATIO OF RETURNEES 
                                         TO Z.I. MEN THAT PREVAILED AT THE FIVE

0                METHOD OF SAMPLING AND DATA COLLECTION                          
                    FOR THE GENERAL CASE, SAMPLING WAS A TWO-STEP PROCESS.       
                    FIRST, THERE WAS SAMPLING OF ORGANIZATIONS WHICH CAN BE      
                    DESCRIBED AS PURPOSIVE OR QUOTA SAMPLING.  SECOND,           
                    WITHIN AN ORGANIZATION THERE WAS SAMPLING OF INDIVIDUALS     
                    INVOLVING PROCEDURES WHICH MIGHT BE CALLED PROBABILITY       
                    SAMPLING.                                                    
0                1. SELECTION OF ORGANIZATIONS TO BE INCLUDED IN A STUDY: THE    
                    SELECTION OF UNITS INVOLVED PURPOSIVE RATHER THAN STRICTLY   
                    RANDOM SAMPLING.  IF A CROSS-SECTION OF ENLISTED MEN IN      
                    THE UNITED STATES OR A THEATER WAS REQUIRED, THE STANDARD    
                    PROCEDURE WAS TO SELECT THE UNITS SUCH THAT EACH BRANCH OF   
                    SERVICE WAS REPRESENTED IN AS NEARLY AS POSSIBLE THE CORRECT 
                    PROPORTIONS.  THE RESEARCH BRANCH HAD ACCESS TO THE LATEST   
                    SECRET DATA ON TROOP STRENGTH AND LOCATION OF UNITS.         
                    WITHIN A GIVEN BRANCH OF SERVICE, EFFORT WAS MADE TO GET     
                    UNITS IN VARIOUS STAGES OF TRAINING OR WITH VARIOUS TYPES    
                    OF ARMY EXPERIENCE IN CORRECT PROPORTIONS, IN SO FAR AS THIS 
                    COULD BE INFERRED FROM AVAILABLE DATA.  HAVING STRATIFIED    
                    THE UNIVERSE BY BRANCH AND TYPE OF UNIT, ONE OR MORE UNITS   
                    FROM EACH SUBCELL OF THIS STRATIFIED UNIVERSE WERE DRAWN.    
                    PRACTICAL CONSIDERATIONS OF TIME AND PERSONNEL USUALLY       
                    PREVENTED A STRICTLY RANDOM SELECTION OF UNITS WITHIN THE    
                    SUBCELL; IT WAS MUCH FASTER TO GET A VARIETY OF UNITS AT A   
                    FEW POSTS THAN ONE UNIT AT MANY POSTS.  PRESELECTION OF UNITS
                    WAS DONE IN WASHINGTON FOR TROOPS IN THE UNITED STATES OR AT 
                    THEATER HEADQUARTERS FOR TROOPS OVERSEAS.                    
0                2. SAMPLING OF INDIVIDUALS WITHIN A UNIT: THE STANDARD PROCEDURE
                    WAS TO DRAW THE NAMES OF EVERY NTH MAN FROM A DUTY ROSTER.   
                    OR, IF THE STUDY DESIGN CALLED FOR CERTAIN NUMBERS AT A      
                    GIVEN RANK OR A GIVEN AGE, THE RESEARCH TEAM HAD ACCESS TO   
                    THE SOLDIER,S FORM 20 CARDS CONTAINING ALL SUCH INFORMATION.

0                   FOR ANY DESIRED CATEGORY OF MEN THESE CARDS COULD BE SAMPLED 
                    AT RANDOM AND THE MEN WHOSE NAMES WERE DRAWN COULD BE        
                    ORDERED TO APPEAR AT A DESIGNATED TIME AND PLACE.            
0                3. QUESTIONNAIRE ADMINISTRATION: NORMALLY A SAMPLE OF ABOUT     
                    FIFTY ENLISTED MEN WERE ASSEMBLED BY ORDER OF THEIR UNIT     
                    COMMANDER AT A PLACE CONVENIENT FOR WRITING.  THE CLASS      
                    LEADER WAS ALMOST ALWAYS AN ENLISTED MAN TRAINED FOR THE     
                    PURPOSE.  THE QUESTIONNAIRES WERE FILLED OUT ANONYMOUSLY BY  
                    THE MEN, IT HAVING BEEN ESTABLISHED THAT NO SIGNIFICANT      
                    DIFFERENCES OCCURRED IN RESPONSES WITH PERSONAL INTERVIEWS.  
                    MEN WITH LITTLE EDUCATION OR WHO WERE HAVING DIFFICULTY      
                    READING THE QUESTIONNAIRE WERE INTERVIEWED INDIVIDUALLY      
                    (PERSONALLY INTERVIEWED NEGRO TROOPS HAD NEGRO               
                    INTERVIEWERS).                                               
0                4. CHECKING THE ADEQUACY OF THE SAMPLE AFTER IT WAS TAKEN:      
                    AFTER EACH SURVEY THE SAMPLING EXPERTS CHECKED THE RETURNS   
                    TO SEE WHETHER LARGE BIASES HAD OCCURRED ON VARIABLES FOR    
                    WHICH DATA WERE AVAILABLE FOR THE UNIVERSE - SUCH AS RANK,   
                    LENGTH OF TIME IN THE ARMY, AGE, ETC.  IN A FEW INSTANCES,   
                    THE SAMPLE REVEALED A BIAS; WHEN FEASIBLE A CORRECTIVE SAMPLE
                    WAS DRAWN IMMEDIATELY.  IT WAS FELT THAT BIASES INTRODUCED   
                    BY SAMPLING DESIGNS AND THEIR FIELD EXECUTION WERE VERY      
                    SMALL AS COMPARED WITH THOSE ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE WORDING OF  
                    QUESTIONS.  MUCH EFFORT WAS PUT INTO IMPROVING METHODS OF    
                    QUESTION DESIGN.
