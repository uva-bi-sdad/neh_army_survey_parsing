            outfits in 5 Army Air Force, 13 Army Ground Force and Army

            United States.  From this a sub-sample of 3000 Negro enlisted        
            men was derived which was a representative cross-section of          
            all Negro enlisted men in the Army (identified in card 1:

            Various white (AMS032W) and Negro (AMS032N) units                    
            throughout the United States were so selected that a                 
            small sample from each would build up to a representative            
            cross section of the Army.  The sampling procedure was               
            not intended to comprise a representative cross section              
            of any one unit.                                                     
            Anonymity was reserved for each respondent and no                    
            identification was made of individual units in the                   
            analysis of the results.                                             
            Two procedures were followed in gathering the data.  In              
            one, men reported in groups of about fifty to predesignated          
            places to fill out their answers to their questions                  
            themselves.  In the other, men reported individually and             
            were personally interviewed.  In both procedures, trained            
            enlisted personnel were used.                                        
            Negro enlisted men trained by Negro officers of the                  
            I and E division conducted the survey in Negro units and             
            white enlisted personnel conducted the survey in white               
            units.                                                               
            In each Negro unit half of the men called were from the              
            South and half from the North.  Men in AGCT Class V who had          
            received 4 grades or less of schooling and all illiterates           
            were personally interviewed by trained personnel.                    
            No personal interviewing was done among white personnel              
            so that illiterates and Class V men were omitted from                
            the white sample.                                                    
0     METHOD OF SAMPLING AND DATA COLLECTION                                     
            For the general case, sampling was a two-step process.               
            First, there was sampling of organizations which can be              
            described as purposive or quota sampling.  Second,                   
            within an organization there was sampling of individuals             
            involving procedures which might be called probability               
            sampling.                                                            
0     1.    Selection of organizations to be included in a study:                
            The selection of units involved purposive rather than                
            strictly random sampling.  If a cross-section of enlisted            
            men in the United States or a theater was required, the              
            standard procedure was to select the units such that                 
            each branch of service was represented in as nearly as               
            possible the correct proportions.  The research branch               
            had access to the latest secret data on troop strength               
            and location of units.  Within a given branch of                     
1                                                                                
-                                                                                
            service, effort was made to get units in various stages              
            of training or with various types of army experience                 
            in correct proportions, in so far as this could be                   
            inferred from available data.  Having stratified the                 
            universe by branch and type of unit, one or more units               
            from each subcell of this stratified universe were                   
            drawn.  Practical considerations of time and personnel               
            usually prevented a strictly random selection of units               
            within the subcell.  It was much faster to get a                     
            variety of units at a few posts than one unit at many                
            posts.  Preselection of units was done in Washington for             
            troops in the United States or at theater headquarters               
            for troops overseas.                                                 
0     2.    Sampling of individuals within a unit:  The standard                 
            procedure was to draw the names of every nth man from                
            a duty roster, or, if the study design called for certain            
            numbers at a given rank or a given age, the research                 
            team had access to the soldier's form 20 cards                       
            containing all such information.  For any desired                    
            category of men these cards could be sampled at random               
            and the men whose names were drawn could be ordered to               
            appear at a designated time and place.                               
0     3.    Qestionnaire administration:  Normally a sample of                   
            about fifty enlisted men were assembled by order of their            
            unit commander at a place convenient for writing.  The               
            class leader was almost always an enlisted man trained               
            for the purpose.  The questionnaires were filled out                 
            anonymously by the men, it having been established that              
            no significant differences occurred in responses with                
            personal interviews.  Men with little education or who               
            were having difficulty reading the questionnaire were                
            interviewed individually (personally interviewed Negro               
            troops had Negro interviewers).                                      
0     4.    Checking the adequacy of the sample after it was                     
            taken:  After each survey the sampling experts checked               
            the returns to see whether large biases had occurred on              
            variables for which data were available for the universe -           
            such as rank, length of time in the army, age, etc.  In              
            a few instances, the sample revealed a bias; when feasible           
            a corrective sample was drawn immediately.  It was felt              
            that biases introduced by sampling designs and their                 
            field execution were very small as compared with those               
            attributable to the wording of questions.  Much effort               
            was put into improving methods of question design.
